# imageGallery

Project Description
For this project, we will be using MDN's Image Gallery Tutorial and expanding from their baseline project.

You will be provided with some HTML, CSS and image assets (from the tutorial link below) and a few lines of JavaScript code; you need to write the necessary JavaScript to turn this into a working program.

MVP
By default, the app should let a user see a gallery of images on the pages from the zip file provided by MDN.
Tech Stack

Requirements
To complete the assignment, you must complete the following:
Complete all steps from the MDN instructions
It is easy to just copy their example code, try as hard as you can to type everything on your own, it will benefit you in the long run.
Complete as many stretch goals as you can; they are listed in order of usefulness.

Here is an example of how to extend the Bouncing Balls Project

Stretch Goals
Create a second gallery on the page.
Implement keyUp or keyDown events to cycle through images
If you have previously completed this assignment in the Intro to Web class, find a way to expand on what youâ€™ve already completed. 
Once you have completed the project submit the Github repo URL and proceed to the next section.
